## Contributing

To contribute to this site, open an issue [here](https://github.com/jsmithdev/coastal-crowd/issues) for:

- General questions about the site
- Suggestions for improvement
- Adding components or solutions to the site

All components and solutions need a few things:

- A readme / documentation
- A screenshot of it in use
- Ready to deploy w/ required tests
- Github author and repository name

With that, we can add them to the ["database" here](https://github.com/jsmithdev/component-land-data) and they'll be live

## 👩‍💻 Development

`npm i` to install dependencies

`npm start` to have webpack serve the app

`npm run watch` to have webpack serve and live reload

`npm run build` or `npm run build:dev` to build to /dist

> During build, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) uses the common (prod or dev) [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js)
